# Parametric Box Generator

This project is a parametric model designed to generate printable boxes based on the ISO-216 standard. The model allows users to easily create boxes of various sizes by adjusting a few parameters.

## Features

- **Parametric Design**: Easily adjust dimensions to generate boxes of different sizes.
- **ISO-216 Compliance**: Ensures that the generated boxes conform to the ISO-216 standard.
- **Printable Output**: Generates models that can be directly printed on a 3D printer.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A 3D printer capable of printing models in the specified dimensions.
- A 3D modeling software that supports parametric design (e.g., OpenSCAD).

### Usage

1. Adjust the parameters in the model to specify the desired box dimensions.
2. Generate the model.
3. Print the model using your 3D printer.
